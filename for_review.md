# For Review

The `foam/foamfield_new.py` module remains an experimental prototype and is not currently functional. It should be ignored when evaluating the working implementation.

The following files have been added relative to the project root:

- REVIEW.md
- foam/mesh.py
- tests/unit/test_mesh_tensordata.py
- tests/unit/test_metrics_and_plotting.py
- tests/unit/test_round_trip.py
- tests/unit/test_simulation_case.py
- tests/unit/test_tensor_conversion.py
